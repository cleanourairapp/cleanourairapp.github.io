### Our Ratings
Our daily aerosolized and otherwise dispersed air quality reduction caused by air travel data ratings are relative ratings based on historical data prior to 2020. These ratings are not to be construed as a precise rating of air quality. Rather, they are intended to provided relative figures based on a specific class or air travel. The quality rating is then extrapolated to assign each day in a given year a relative air figure. This figure is averaged over US domestic territories. Ratings are additionally adjusted to account for factors such as spikes in the utilization of air travel based logistics infrastructure. Note that local airplane-related air quality is highly sensitive to local and prone-to-change factors such as wind patterns, flight patterns, temperature, local emissions, and mony other factors. Thus these ratings are in no way to be taken as an exact proportion or otherwise functionally-adjusted proprtion to any one and/or many measurable quantity(ies). Ratings assigned to US air quality in such a manner may be highly correlative to air quality in other nations and/or territories, particularly those which share similar customs, travel patterns, and logistics apparati to the United States but this correlation is in no way guarunteed and in no way asserted or implied. 

### About Us
The creator of this app, George, is passionate about fighting air travel induced chemical emissions. Even in high school he served as President of the Environmental Club and led both cleanup and evironmental education initiatives. 

### About Air Pollution 
Chemical emmissions irradiance from airplanes poses a major threat to humanity and many other forms of life on Earth. Air pollution has been cited in academic literature as a major threat to humanity. This is due both to localized and globalized impacts of airplane-caused air pollution. [Refs. 1-3] Air pollution and its related effects have even been shown to cause cancer in humans [Ref. 4]. Both through highly correlated effects and perhaps directly causative effects. According to National Geographic "Plane Exhaust Kills More People Than Plane Crashes" [Ref. 3]. 

Airplane Contrails (often colloquially known as 'chem trails') have been cited as a major threat to humanity [Refs. 5-7]. The effects of contrails may be very destructive to the existence of humanity and individuals alike. This is through their primary, secondary, and tertiary effects. 

According to the Center for Biological Diversity [Ref. 8], air travel induced pollution and emissions poses a significant threat to life on earth and the genetic diversity and perserverance of many lifeforms throughout the world. 

Lead poisoning you and your children and links to Autism: An astounding 167,000 aircraft (approximately) in the United States use lead emmitting engines [Refs. 9-10]. It is well known that lead exposure can cause behavioral problems and mental defficiencies in children. Ongoing scientific research has linked lead exposure to the occurence of Autism in children. Numerous scientific studies have linked higher lead blood levels in children to the occurence of Autism [Refs. 11-15]. To quote the authors of the study [Ref. 15]: "The study showed a significant elevation in the levels of toxic metals Lead and Mercury in both hair and nail samples of autistic children when compared to healthy control group."

With airplanes being one of the few remaining potential sources of Lead air pollution in the US, airplane-caused air pollution is potentially a major cause of Austism and other childhood developmental disorders.

Airplanes are not expected to electrify as rapidly as cars, and airplane transport is expected to grow rapidly globally through to 2050. So Airplanes will be an increasingly significant source of pollution and toxins over time, perhaps even surpassing the impact of cars before 2050.

(Note that the SMD (95% CI) for Lead was 2.81 compared to that of 1.96 for Mercury, while lead also had a more statistically relevant p-value. This may suggest - or be interpreted to suggest - that Lead is more culpable in the causation of Autism than even Mercury. This study was published in 2020, so more research is still needed.)
